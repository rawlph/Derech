Balance Ideas:
Balance Colony with Power, Water, Colony Goods, Workforce, Trust, Morale, raw materials, processed materials

To keep things simpler, we abstracize.
we mine raw resources (iron oxide, H2O, whatever fits scientifically), we process them (plastics, chips, whatever), we gain colony goods (luxury products, health products, medicine, etc).

Balance with exploration & expansion. Things looking good? we expand. Things looking bad? we stabilize. We should always be enticed to scout tiles, when things look bad or good.

research tech: makes scouting, expansion and resource management efficient and unlocks higher "tiers" and more complex gameplay.

have failsafe mechanisms based on trust: we start expanding too fast, losing resources and cant keep up? colony loses population, loses trust in AI. Colony starts denying control progressively, making the game abandon expanded hex tiles, reducing research and focusing on raw materials and repopulating the colony. something like that.. it keeps our progress "at hand" (we can reconquer abandoned tiles). We only get punished by losing research and having to work our way back for a bit.

handle an amount of resource flow by using events and our puzzle area.
