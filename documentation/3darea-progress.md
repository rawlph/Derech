# Unified 3D Scene Framework Implementation Plan

## Introduction
This document outlines our three-step plan for implementing a unified 3D scene framework for our lightweight mobile web game. The goal is to create consistent camera behavior, player movement, and interaction systems across all puzzle scenes while maintaining good performance on mobile devices.

## Step 1: Core Movement System ☐
**Goal**: Create a reusable player character and movement system that works across all scenes

- [ ] Create a `Player` component with:
  - [ ] Sphere model with customizable appearance
  - [ ] Core physics/movement logic
  - [ ] Collision detection system
  - [ ] First-person camera attachment

- [ ] Implement unified controls:
  - [ ] Desktop: WASD movement
  - [ ] Desktop: Space/Ctrl for vertical movement
  - [ ] Desktop: Mouse look with rotation constraints
  - [ ] Mobile: Left joystick (NippleJS) for movement
  - [ ] Mobile: Right joystick for look/camera rotation
  - [ ] Touch screen drag for camera rotation alternative

- [ ] Movement behavior:
  - [ ] Floating/hovering effect
  - [ ] Smooth acceleration/deceleration
  - [ ] Adjustable speed and physics parameters
  - [ ] Auto-leveling when not actively controlling

## Step 2: Scene Architecture & Management ☐
**Goal**: Create a standardized scene structure allowing different puzzles within the same framework

- [ ] Implement `BaseScene` component that:
  - [ ] Accepts the Player component
  - [ ] Provides standardized lighting
  - [ ] Manages rendering optimization
  - [ ] Handles scene transitions

- [ ] Create unified interaction system:
  - [ ] Raycasting for object interaction
  - [ ] Interactive object highlighting
  - [ ] Distance-based interaction triggers
  - [ ] Unified interaction prompt UI

- [ ] Implement SceneManager in Zustand:
  - [ ] Track scene loading/unloading
  - [ ] Preserve player state between scenes
  - [ ] Handle asset preloading
  - [ ] Manage scene-specific state

- [ ] Dialogue system integration:
  - [ ] Trigger dialogue based on scene events
  - [ ] Consistent dialogue UI across scenes
  - [ ] Support for dialogue choices

## Step 3: Performance Optimization & Polish ☐
**Goal**: Ensure smooth performance across devices and add polish

- [ ] Performance optimization:
  - [ ] Level of detail (LOD) system
  - [ ] Object pooling for frequently used objects
  - [ ] Texture atlas optimization
  - [ ] Instance batching where possible

- [ ] Add visual polish:
  - [ ] Player movement effects (trail, particles)
  - [ ] Smooth scene transitions
  - [ ] Lighting effects suited to each puzzle theme
  - [ ] Post-processing effects (optional, performance dependent)

- [ ] Audio system:
  - [ ] Spatial audio for 3D environment
  - [ ] Movement sound effects
  - [ ] Ambient sound system
  - [ ] Audio settings and mute toggle

- [ ] Testing and refinement:
  - [ ] Cross-browser testing
  - [ ] Mobile device testing
  - [ ] Performance profiling
