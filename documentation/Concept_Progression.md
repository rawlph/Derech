Game Concept and Progression:
** Handle concrete numbers as suggestions and vague ideas. - double-check if they fit our balance **

We start on a hex grid, orthographic, 7x7, expanding outwards limited by our rules for performance. 3x3 tiles are visible, and our colony spawns at three connected tiles -> Living Dome, Production Dome, Research Dome.. we can expand with scouting sites, mining sites, research sites, various other options for tiles, as our game progresses.
We can explore tiles around us, and discover valuable resource sites, interesting science sites, perhaps some plausible sci-fi flavor. 
Not every tile has a story or reward.. some tiles simply cause interhuman issues. we are the Moses AI, and its on our path to guide them. through their handheld devices and dialogue trees of course :).

One integral part and of our game, and some kind of "main quest", will be the Embodiment Project.
a series of research projects, each connected to puzzle games in our 3d area, where our AI connects with chosen humans in our colony, based on their aptitude for interfacing with the AI (us).

We devise some mini-games, add philosophical, biological science flavor, and upon completion, we unlock more complexity and efficiency in our Management Game.

That's the jist of it our game idea.
