Goal: Scenic but lightweight and performant.
Keywords: Low-poly, stylized, clean UI, minimal textures (or baked lighting textures), focus on atmosphere through color and simple shapes. Prioritize smoothness over visual fidelity.
Tech: Mobile Responsiveness for landscape view mobile and desktop view.

Specifics:
Management Area: Almost 2d top, but orthogonal camera over Hexgrid. Mars colors and low poly colony assets, perhaps placeholders for simple 2d graphics.
Unexplored Hex = dark caramel, UI = clean windows98-look with some cyber elements.

3d Puzzle Area:
simple basic vanilla scene which we can modify for our needs.
