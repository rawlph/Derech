# Mars Colony Management Game Mechanics Documentation

## Core Game Loop

The Mars Colony Management Game operates on a round-based system where players manage resources, assign workforce, construct buildings, respond to issues, and expand their colony on the Martian surface.

### Game Loop Overview

1. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor and allocate key resources (power, water, minerals, colony goods)
   - Balance production against consumption

2. **Building & Task Management**
   - Deploy specialized buildings (mining operations, solar arrays, etc.)
   - Assign workforce to tasks
   - Monitor operational status of facilities

3. **Issue Resolution**
   - Respond to random events and issues
   - Make strategic choices with resource tradeoffs

4. **Colony Expansion**
   - Construct new facilities to extend capabilities
   - Research technologies to unlock new options
   - Deconstruct outdated or inefficient buildings

5. **Round Advancement**
   - End current round to progress time
   - Trigger production cycles, building progress, and potential issues

## Resource System

### Resource Types

- **Power (‚ö°)**: Primary energy resource for operations
- **Water (üíß)**: Essential life support resource
- **Minerals (‚õèÔ∏è)**: Raw materials used for construction
- **Colony Goods (üì¶)**: Manufactured products for construction and maintenance
- **Research Points (üî¨)**: Used for technology advancement
- **Workforce (üë∑)**: Derived from population (80% of total population)

### Resource Generation & Consumption

- **Base Power Production**: +5 power units per round
- **Population Water Consumption**: 1 water unit per population per round
- **Building-Specific Generation**: Buildings generate resources based on type and location
- **Shutdown Power Savings**: Shutdown buildings save 80% of their normal power consumption

## Building & Task System

### Building Lifecycle

1. **Deployment**: Buildings require:
   - Valid terrain type
   - Resource costs
   - Assigned workforce
   - Construction duration (in rounds)

2. **Construction**: Buildings show completion percentage during deployment
   - Progress = 100 / duration per round

3. **Operational**: Once construction is complete, buildings become operational
   - Generate resources
   - Can be affected by issues

4. **Shutdown**: Buildings can be temporarily shutdown
   - Reduces resource consumption
   - Preserves workforce assignment
   - Visually appears dimmed
   - Automatically restored at the end of round

5. **Deconstruction**: Players can remove buildings through deconstruction
   - Takes 4 rounds to complete
   - Progress increases by 25% each round
   - Returns assigned workforce upon completion
   - Visual appearance changes during deconstruction (reddish tint, growing transparency)
   - After 50% completion, buildings appear in wireframe mode

### Task Types and Resource Generation

| Building Type | Resource Generated | Base Amount | Location Bonus | Rate (Rounds) |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Mining Operation | Minerals | 5 | +50% per mountain height level | Every round |
| Solar Array | Power | 10 | None | Every round |
| Geothermal Plant | Power | 25 | None | Every round |
| Water Well | Water | 15 | None | Every round |
| Scout Outpost | Research Points | 2 | None | Every round |

## Issue System

### Issue Generation

- Each building type has a defined issue rate (chance of triggering an issue)
- Rates are defined in `buildingIssueRates` in the issues.ts configuration:

| Building Type | Issue Rate (Rounds) |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Mining Operation | 6 |
| Water Well | 8 |
| Scout Outpost | 2 |
| Geothermal Plant | 16 |
| Solar Array | 4 |

- Issues only generate for buildings in 'operational' status
- Only one issue can be active per building at a time
- Issue checks occur during the end of each round

### Issue Resolution

1. When an issue occurs, players receive a notification
2. Players can view the issue details in the Issue Window
3. Each issue offers multiple resolution choices, each with:
   - Potential resource costs
   - Different outcome effects
   - Possible shutdown consequences
4. After selecting a choice:
   - Resource costs are deducted
   - Outcome effects are applied
   - Building status may change (e.g., to 'shutdown')
   - The issue is marked as resolved

2. **Research-Locked Special Issues**: These are building-specific, non-repeatable events that unlock only after completing specific research projects. They typically provide significant benefits or strategic choices:

| Building Type | Required Research | Special Issue |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Scout Outpost | Enhanced Rover Optics | Ancient Structure Detected - discovery of an abandoned early expedition site |
| Mining Operation | Efficient Mining Drills | Rich Subsurface Mineral Vein - discovery of valuable mineral deposits |
| Water Well | Atmospheric Water Capture | Subterranean Ice Chamber - discovery of pristine ice deposits |

These special issues provide unique narrative moments and significant resource boosts that reward research investment and strategic building placement.

### Project Lifecycle

1. **Initiation**: Player selects a project and pays the resource cost
2. **Progress**: Each round adds progress based on the formula: Progress = 100 / duration per round
3. **Completion**: When a project reaches 100% completion:
   - A completion message is displayed
   - The project's effects are applied to the game systems
   - The project moves to the "Completed Projects" list
   - Visual UI updates: "Start" buttons change to "Finished!" (green to blue)

### Project Interface

The research and project windows allow players to:
- View active project progress with progress bars
- See available projects with costs and effect descriptions
- Browse completed projects to remember their effects
- Start new projects if sufficient resources are available

## Building Deployment Costs

### Task Deployment Costs

| Building Type | Power Cost | Minerals Cost | Colony Goods Cost | Workforce Required | Duration (Rounds) |
|---------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Mining Operation | 20 | 0 | 10 | 3 | 2 |
| Scout Outpost | 10 | 0 | 5 | 1 | 1 |
| Solar Array | 0 | 15 | 5 | 2 | 3 |
| Geothermal Plant | 0 | 25 | 10 | 5 | 4 |
| Water Well | 15 | 20 | 0 | 3 | 3 |

## Deconstruction Mechanics

### Process Overview

1. **Initiation**: Player selects "Deconstruct" option for an operational building
2. **Status Change**: Building enters 'deconstructing' status with 0% progress
3. **Visual Transformation**:
   - Building turns reddish color
   - Gradually becomes more transparent as deconstruction progresses
   - At 50% deconstruction, building switches to wireframe rendering
4. **Progress**: Each round adds 25% to deconstruction progress (4 rounds total)
5. **Completion**: When progress reaches 100%:
   - Building is removed
   - Tile is cleared
   - Workforce is returned to the available pool
   - Notification is displayed

### Deconstruction Visual States

| Progress | Appearance |
|----------|------------|
| 0-25% | Slightly reddish tint, minor transparency |
| 26-50% | Redder color, 30-50% transparency |
| 51-75% | Red wireframe, 50-70% transparency |
| 76-99% | Red wireframe, 70-90% transparency |
| 100% | Removed |

### Restrictions

- Buildings with unresolved issues cannot be deconstructed until the issue is resolved
- Deconstruction cannot be cancelled once started

## Rendering and Visual System

Buildings and tasks use different rendering systems depending on their status:

### Status-Based Rendering

| Status | Visual Appearance |
|--------|-------------------|
| Deploying | Normal model with progress indicator |
| Operational | Normal model |
| Shutdown | Dimmed model (darker by 50%) |
| Deconstructing | Reddish model with increasing transparency and wireframe |

## Round Cycle Processing

When the player ends a round, the following processes execute in sequence:

1. Task progress updates (construction advancement)
2. Resource generation from operational facilities
3. Base resource consumption and production
4. Building issue generation based on building-specific rates
5. Research and project progress updates
6. Restoration of shutdown facilities to operational status
7. Resource balance updates
8. Workforce recalculation
9. Round counter increment

## Development Notes

- The event system framework exists but is currently disabled (chance set to 0)
- The game tracks both 'building' types (permanent structures) and 'task' operations (deployable activities)
- Issue rates are configurable on a per-building-type basis in issues.ts
- Building resource generation and costs are defined in tasks.ts
- Research and project effects are defined in their respective configuration files
