Purpose: Engage the player in solving problems, exploring environments, or making decisions in a 3D context. Triggered by events from the Management Area. Explore some Hex Tiles in simple 3d view.
Framework: Full 3D using R3F/Drei. Keep environments simple/stylized/low-poly for performance.
Movement:
Implement a basic character controller (e.g., a simple capsule or sphere representing the player).
Use NippleJS for directional input on mobile (and potentially map WASD/Arrow keys for desktop).
Kinematic Movement: Translate NippleJS input directly into velocity/position changes for the character model.
Simple Collision: Implement basic bounding box checks against designated obstacles in the scene to prevent walking through walls. Do not use a full physics engine for this initially.
Camera: Simple third-person follow camera (Drei has <OrbitControls> or you can implement a basic lerping follow-cam).
Interaction System (Placeholders):
Dialogue: A system to display text overlays (simple HTML div positioned over the canvas). Ability to show text from an "NPC" (can just be triggered by interacting with an object initially). Basic choice buttons (e.g., "Yes"/"No"), with option for deep dialogue trees.
Puzzle Objects: Ability to designate certain objects in the 3D scene as interactable (e.g., change color on hover/click, trigger a dialogue or state change).
Accessing Colony Data: Show how the Puzzle Area component can read data from the Zustand store (e.g., display current Power level in a dialogue).
Puzzle Variety Idea: Keep it simple initially. Example: Enter a damaged power conduit area, navigate to a control panel (movement), interact with it (click), choose between simple options "Apply Software Fix" (cost power), "Delegate Hardware Fix" (cost workforce: get reward accordingly.  
Rewards: On successful completion, update the Zustand state (e.g., add resources, mark quest complete, unlock tech) and transition back to the Management Area.
